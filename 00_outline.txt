installs
    matplotlib
    numpy
	PIL
    run check script
    
What is "Pythonic"? 
	import this
	Readable (simple)
	Reusable
	
Senario: DrySim and Fortran
	
Finding your way:
    os
        getcwd()      Return a string representing the current working directory.
        listdir(path) Return a list containing the names of the entries in the directory.
        chdir(path)   Change the current working directory to the specified path.
     
    os.path
        join()         Join two or more pathname components, inserting "\" as needed
        dirname(path)  Returns the directory component of a pathname
        basename(path) Returns the final component of a pathname
        split(path)    Return tuple (head, tail) where tail is everything after the final slash.
        exists(path)   Test whether a path exists
        isfile(path)   Test whether a path is a regular file
        isdir(path)    Test whether a path is a directory
        walk(path, func, arg) Directory tree walk with callback function.
        
Cracking the nuts:                    
    files
        open(name[, mode[, buffering]]) -> file object. Modes = [r]ead, [w]rite
        read([size]) -> read at most size bytes, returned as a string.
        readline([size]) -> next line from the file, as a string.
        readlines([size]) -> list of strings, each a line from the file.
        write()
        close()
        with?

	
01 -> Installation check (matplotlib, numpy, PIL). Questions from last class?	
02 -> Interactive session exploring environment, methods, and tools.
03 -> Load file & graph single parameter (Drying Rate vs. Distance from vapor.csv).
04 -> Graph multiple parameters, add legend (Power vs. Distance from power.csv).
05 -> Parse file to extract value and write to file.
06 -> Functionalize routine to itterate over multiple locations.
07 -> Add a function, get topAirVelocity from variablesDME.txt
08 -> Get topAirTemperature from vapor.out using split() and list index.
09 -> Contour graph of pTotal, Air Temp, Air Velocity.
10 -> Extract XML data using the built-in minidom module.
11 -> Write HTML results file with table, links, and images.
12 -> Image manipulation using Python Image Library (PIL).
